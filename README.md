# fastCell
**fastCell** is a free open-source python software package designed to enable biologists without training in computer vision or programming to utilize cutting edge deep learning technology in their quantitative analysis of biological images.

**fastCell** is developed at the [Mouse Imaging Centre](https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre), where the acquisition of increasingly ambiguous cell types proved too challenging for [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org)'s conventional image analysis algorithms.

Dr. Dulcie Vousden originally published results using CellProfiler in her paper [Whole-brain mapping of behaviourally induced neural activation in mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760545). [tvPipeline]() now automates the entire workflow including the useage of **fastCell**.
